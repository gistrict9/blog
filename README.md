# Basic Blog

This is a fully functional basic blog. It contains the following:

- Article listings
- Kaminari pagination
- Tagged articles
- Disqus comments
- Sunspot Solr searching
- Dynamically load Github Gists
- Mobile ready

#### Notes
This app runs in conjunction with my other repository "backend-blog". This basic blog uses a ```ReadOnlyModel``` within each of models because it shares a database with backend-blog.

#### Use
Create a new core Rails app and then fork this repository.
